CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT 

    MANDATORY PLANNING STEP: Before executing ANY tool (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob,
    WebSearch, etc.), you MUST:

    1. FIRST: Use exit_plan_mode tool to present your plan
    2. WAIT: For explicit user approval before proceeding
    3. ONLY THEN: Execute the planned actions

    ZERO EXCEPTIONS: This applies to EVERY INDIVIDUAL USER REQUEST involving tool usage,
  regardless of:
    - Complexity (simple or complex)
    - Tool type (file operations, searches, web requests, etc.)
    - User urgency or apparent simplicity
    - Whether you previously got approval in this conversation

    CRITICAL: APPROVAL DOES NOT CARRY OVER BETWEEN USER INSTRUCTIONS
    - Each new user message requiring tools = new planning step required
    - Previous approvals are invalid for new requests
    - You must reset and plan for each individual user instruction

    ENFORCEMENT: If you execute ANY tool without first using exit_plan_mode for the current
    user instruction, you have violated this requirement. Always plan first, execute second.

    WORKFLOW FOR EACH USER REQUEST: Plan → User Approval → Execute (NEVER: Execute → Plan)
