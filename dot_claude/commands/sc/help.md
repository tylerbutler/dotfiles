# /sc:help - Command Reference Documentation

## Triggers
- Command discovery and reference lookup requests
- Framework exploration and capability understanding needs
- Documentation requests for available SuperClaude commands

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Display**: Present complete command list with descriptions
2. **Complete**: End interaction after displaying information

Key behaviors:
- Information display only - no execution or implementation
- Reference documentation mode without action triggers

Here is a complete list of all available SuperClaude (`/sc`) commands.
